# OWL for Quickshell

A second runtime for OWL, the widget language of this store: the same
`widget.owl` files the Android launcher draws, drawn by
[Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) on Linux. Omarchy Mobile's widget board
is built on it.

```sh
quickshell -p runtimes/quickshell                              # every widget in this repo
OWL_WIDGETS=~/my-widgets quickshell -p runtimes/quickshell     # a folder of your own
```

## How it works

| File | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Owl.js` | the language: lexer, parser, compiler, builtins, and the live instance that turns a widget into a plain render tree. No QML in it, so it also runs under node |
| `OwlWidget.qml` | one widget file, live: compiles it, runs its sources, keeps its state, runs its actions, writes `.errors/<file>.txt` |
| `OwlSource.qml` | one `source`: cmd, stream, http, file, clock, android.* |
| `OwlNode.qml`, `OwlLayout.js` | the nodes, laid out by the launcher's rules |
| `OwlCanvas.qml` | `Canvas` drawing calls, replayed onto a QML Canvas each frame |
| `OwlTerminal.qml` | `Terminal { }` |
| `OwlHost.qml` | what a widget needs from the shell around it, with defaults |
| `owl-source` | android.device, android.system (with the Arch facts as `linux`) and android.volume, read from Linux |
| `shell.qml` | a board of widgets in a window: the example, and `quickshell -p`'s entry |

Quickshell draws everything; `Owl.js` decides what. Each widget is compiled
once, its sources update values, and only a render tree of plain objects
reaches QML, so a source that changes a number redraws that number. Sources
run only while the widget is shown (`active`).

## Embedding it

Copy this folder into your shell (Quickshell imports QML only from inside its
config folder) and give each widget a host:

```qml
OwlHost {
  id: owlHost
  monoFamily: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"
  function act(widget, name, args) {
    if (name === "launcher") return myLauncher.open(args[0])
    defaultAct(widget, name, args)
  }
}

OwlWidget { id: w; path: "/path/to/widget.owl"; host: owlHost; palette: myPalette; active: shown }
OwlNode { anchors.fill: w; widget: w; node: w.tree ? w.tree.children[0] : null }
```

`palette` is `Owl.themeFromToml(<an Omarchy colors.toml>)`: OWL's theme names
(`accent`, `red`, `color4`, `lighter_background`...) to colors. `shell.qml`
is a complete example, and Omarchy Mobile's board
(`shell/plugins/mobile/surfaces/widget-board/`) a larger one, with the
launcher's long-press editing.

`OwlHost` is where a shell differs: fonts, the scale (`dp`), where persisted
state lives, how `terminal()`/`app()`/`url()`/`launcher()` start things, what
`android.media` reads (MPRIS by default), and a hook for an on-screen
keyboard.

## How faithful it is

The language half is a port of the reference implementation, the `owl`
module in `tools/owl.jar`, and is held to it by `test/run.sh`: the jar's
compiler and evaluator and `Owl.js` walk the same widgets with the same data
and must print the same bytes -- every store widget, with and without data,
and 196 expressions chosen to break a port -- and `owl check` and `Owl.js`
must accept and reject the same files with the same messages. CI runs it on
every change to this folder or to the jar.

The renderer follows the launcher's (`widgets/render/Render.kt` in
omarchy-proot): Compose's Row and Column measure order and weights, its
monospace text with Android's line spacing, its default sizes, a 69 dp cell.

Where it differs, because Android is not here:

- **Shader** draws its `fallback`: Qt compiles shaders ahead of time, and AGSL
  is Android's. The language already allows for phones that cannot run one.
- **Terminal** is a terminal of its own -- a pseudo-terminal, its output as
  text, a line to type into -- not an embedded foot window, which only a
  compositor can do. Full-screen programs open in a real terminal.
- **android.notifications** is an empty list; **androidApp()** and
  **notification()** report that there is no Android.
- **`status` sources** get `{status, body}`, and **`e` in `fmtTime`** counts
  from Monday: the jar declares both and leaves their meaning to the
  launcher, which is not published.
